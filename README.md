### A True Perspective: The Intricacies of the Primary Care Physician Shortage Impact on Urban Populations - Policy Brief
[Link to full Policy Brief]()

Oftentimes when discussing the pitfalls of the ongoing health care system’s challenges in supplying equitable and quality care for all patients the steadily increasing physician care shortage is often overlooked and undermined. In a society that deems itself foundational on prestige and return of investment, many individuals pursuing medicine are often prompted to specialize in a field that can abundantly create a return on their hard-earned education. With the ever-increasing tuition costs of medical school and overall health are utilization due to an increasingly unhealth population within the United States, we are now more than ever promoted to investigate the underlying issues relating to the formerly stated issue.  To further explore its ramifications, we must first work to understand that after the Affordable Care Act, a huge change that is increasingly imperative is the mandating for insurance companies to cover chronic diseases. At first, this just seems to be more of an objective than an issue until we see that there is simply not enough institutional support within the medical system to deal with the health care management of many individuals with underlying chronic diseases. Furthermore, with the lack institutional support we often see that those with a lower socioeconomic status and access such to medical care, such as those existing in urban populations simply become a part of the ever-increasing gap created by this issue. Due to this, within these urban populations it is evident that there is a lack of general care within the space of children’s health, general surgery and mental health therefore also leading to a lack of specialty utilization as primary care physicians are the first point of contact for many individuals of a lower socioeconomic status.

Throughout the previous evaluation of the current circumstances surrounding the primary care physician shortage within urban populations, there are several identifying and pertinent questions that must be positioned to gain foundational grounding. To begin, what are some current solutions towards the physician shortage within the United States and how could they be altered to become more affective for urban populations? In addition to this, will increasing the number of residents within primary care help with the effects of the shortage? With this in mind, an investigation of the data and numbers behind the lack of physician supply and access to care in a majority of urban communities is required. A propositional item and focal point for policy would be improving and expanding the number of primary physicians in inner cities, through providing more educational opportunities for aspiring doctors.  Through the means of utilizing more policy implementation addressing care, quality, and access, we can work to alleviate both sides of the totem pole. Conclusively, this policy brief will be culmination of the serval recommendations to provide of the former aspects.


### Testing the Mysteries of Food Effects (R)
[Full Report](/assets/Testing_the_Mysteries_of_Food_Effects.pdf)

The dataset is known as 'Cancer' retrieved from CDC's division of "United States Cancer Statistics" at: [CDC Cancer Dataset](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/uscs/)


Based on the speculation of GMOs to health effects, my partner and I wanted to explore its relationship to one type of chronic condition, cancer, that is often linked to nutrition and lifestyle factors. In also considering the effect of food andnutrition on the development of chronic conditions, we were also looking at the regulations through legislation on the effect of food production quality which could impact cancer incidence. We expected to find that the increase of GMO could correlate to an increase in cancer incidence and death rates as well as policy rates increasing being effective at protecting the quality of nutrients in the food market that could lower cancer rates.

**Findings:**

**Do genetically engineered crops seem to have an influence on the cancer incidence rate and death rate in the United States?**

Within our research research we hypothesized that the increase of GMO could correlate to an increase in cancer incidence and death rates. In Fig 1.8,visualization created to view the possible relationship between the amount of cancer deaths, the cancer rate and the total GMO adoption amounts for different given years, there seems to be a connection between all 3 variables. Within this visualization we see that as the years go by there is an increase in GMO adoptions and a constant range in cancer deaths over the years. Although the incidence rate decreases a bit in the latter years there is a more widespread distribution of deaths caused by Cancer. Within our visualization we see that the Cancer Incidence Rate used for this analysis report has a normal distribution with an average of 171.5 incidents of cancer per 100,000 people. This rate utilized can further explain why there is not much change in the incidence rate within our visualization throughout the years as the mean value within each state likely varied 16.06 standard deviations. Despite the clear negative correlation in Fig 1.6 between GMO Adoption and Cancer Deaths, the Fig 1.8 showing the relationship between cancer deaths and incidence displays that more GMO adoptions per year has some slight correlation to more cancerous deaths.

When taking a closer look at the potential differences by crop type in Fig 1.7, there are clear diffrences as cotton is the only crop with a positive correlation between incidence rate and GMO adoption. The other two have negative correlations with the corn being highly negative and soybean being slightly negative because cotton is used significantly less as a food product than the other two crop types therefore becoming a limitation of our study.

The relationships portrayed through the visualizations lead us to a conclusion that GMO adoption is not a significant predictor for cancerous deaths, but may have some impact on cancer incidience development.

**What is the relationship between the number of food policy bills and the cancer incidence and death rates over years?**

Within this research research we hypothesized that with an increase in food policy bills there would be a decrease in cancer deaths. In addition to this, the policy rates increasing are effective at protecting the quality of nutrients in the food market that could lower cancer rates. In Fig 1.6, a tri-variate graph represents the relationship between Cancer Death Rate, GMO Adoption and Total Policy Number, the higher the policy number pertaining to GMO adoption the lower the amount of deaths relating to cancer. In the visualization above, most of the data points,with a super high policy number and GMO adoption amount also have low cancer deaths, are clustered in the bottom right. In a similar manner we see a couple of high policy numbers pertaining to high cancer deaths at the top of the visualization with higher death rates, this could be related to legislation being created as a result of thehigh cancer deaths and not as a preventative measure.In further support of this relationship the skewed distribution of Deaths, the median deaths per 100,000 incidents to report is 11958 with the IQR reporting at 13641.

The scatterplot of the three variables and their relationships have visualized the inconsistent effect policy bills have on the impact of cancerous deaths despite the amount of GMO adoptions.

### Attributes of Billed Health Insurance Costs (R, Python)
[Full Report](/assets/Investigating_the_Attributes_of_Billed_Health_Insurance_Costs.pdf)    

The dataset is known as US Health Insurance Dataset retrieved from Kaggle at: [Kaggle Insurance DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset)

Within this dataset the insurance charge is listed and given with other attributes of Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoker and Region with atotal of 1338 patients as observations.Through the creation of classification and prediction models we expected there to be attributes of more significance that directly effect the effectiveness of the models produced. The biggest predictors are expected to be Age, BMI, Children and Smoker Status each being positively related. These stronger correlations are expected to aid in the best classification models being produced from this exploration.

**Findings:**

**Are the age and body mass index of a primary beneficiary member significant predictors of the individual medical costs billed by health insurance companies?**

By no means was this project easy, however the challenge itself highlighted the importance of good and clean data. Based upon our research we witness that individuals who are higher in age are at risk of experience higher insurance charges.Our evidence for this can be attributed to Fig 1.1 In which we explore the relationship between Age and Charges and realize that there is anevidence of a relationship. Although it contributes to greatly to our first dimension with a value of 35.1 percent, its evident that is not a good predictor of individual medical costs billed by insurance companies being that there are similar value points between all clusters for Age and BMI exhibits little contribution to the first dimension explaining the variance of our variables with our data.

**Is smoking status, regional area, and number of children of the benefi ciary member on an insurance plan effective classifiers for the medical costs billed by the health insurance companies?**

To effectively classify the medical costs utilizing the variables smoker status, region,and number of children on the insurance plan through a logistic regression model has produced less than effective results. Using the root square mean value to discern the error margin a large value of approximately $7,500 produce, identifying this limitation significantly skewed predicted charges that affect accurate classification. Creating PAM clustering with the categorical variables using Gower’s dissimilarities hints this idea of smoking status being the prime significant effect in classification by the only two ‘yes’ clusters by having well over average billed health insurance charges. Despite the limitations of the model, some discernment of the effect of the variables can be deciphered knowing that smoking status is significant and number of children having some slight impact while region appears insignificant.
