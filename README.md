**Testing the Mysteries of Food Effects (R)**	
[Full Report](/assets/Testing_the_Mysteries_of_Food_Effects.pdf)

Based on the speculation of GMOs to health effects, my partner and I wanted to explore its relationship to one type of chroniccondition, cancer, that is often linked to nutrition and lifestyle factors. In also considering the effect of food andnutrition on the development of chronic conditions, we were also looking at the regulations through legislationon the effect of food production quality which could impact cancer incidence. We expected to find that the increase of GMO could correlate to an increase in cancer incidence and death rates as well as policy rates increasing being effective at protecting the quality of nutrients in the food market that could lower cancer rates.

**Findings:**
***Do genetically engineered crops seem to have an infl uence on the cancer incidence rate and death rate inthe United States?**

Within our research research we hypothesized that the increase of GMO could correlate to an increase in cancerincidence and death rates. In Fig 1.8,visualization created to view the possible relationship between the amount of cancer deaths, the cancer rate and the total GMO adoption amounts for different given years, there seems to be a connection between all 3 variables. Within this visualization we see that as the years go by there is an increase in GMO adoptions and a constant range in cancer deaths over the years. Although the incidence rate decreases abit in the latter years there is a more widespread distribution of deaths caused by Cancer. Within our visualization we see that the Cancer Incidence Rate used for this analysis report has a normal distribution with an average of 171.5 incidents of cancer per 100,000 people. This rate utilized can further explain why there is not much change in the incidence rate within our visualization throughout the years as the mean value within each state likely varied 16.06 standard deviations. Despite the clear negative correlation in Fig 1.6 between GMO Adoption and Cancer Deaths, the Fig 1.8 showing the relationship between cancer deaths and incidence displays that more GMO adoptions per year has some slight correlation to more cancerous deaths.

When taking a closer look at the potential differences by crop type in Fig 1.7, there are clear diff rences as cottonis the only crop with a positive correlation between incidence rate and GMO adoption. The other two havenegative correlations with the corn being highly negative and soybean being slightly negative because cotton isused significantly less as a food product than the other two crop types this a limitation of our study.

The relationships portrayed through the visualizations lead us to a conclusion that GMO adoption is not asignificant predictor for cancerous deaths, but may have some impact on cancer incidience development.

**What is the relationship between the number of food policy bills and the cancer incidence and death rates over years**

Within this research research we hypothesized that with an increase in food policy bills there would be a decrease in cancer deaths. In addition to this, the policy rates increasing are effective at protecting the quality of nutrients in the food market that could lower cancer rates. In Fig 1.6, a tri-variate graph represents the relationship between Cancer Death Rate, GMO Adoption and Total Policy Number, the higher the policy number pertaining to GMO adoption the lower the amount of deaths relating to cancer. In the visualization above, most of the data points,with a super high policy number and GMO adoption amount also have low cancer deaths, are clustered in the bottom right. In a similar manner we see a couple of high policy numbers pertaining to high cancer deaths at the top of the visualization with higher death rates, this could be related to legislation being created as a result of thehigh cancer deaths and not as a preventative measure.In further support of this relationship the skewed distribution of Deaths, the median deaths per 100,000 incidents to report is 11958 with the IQR reporting at 13641.

The scatterplot of the three variables and their relationships have visualized the inconsistent effect policy billshave on the impact of cancerous deaths despite the amount of GMO adoptions.
